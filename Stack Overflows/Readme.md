# Overview 

Stack buffer overflow was the most scaring vulnrability in any application, but alot of mitigations came out made it more and more harder to exploit, which reduces it's danger alot but it's possible to find it these days.

here I will start documenting my learning process for this vulnerability starting from very beginning level.

I decided to start looking at the following six levels of [how2bof](https://github.com/Caesurus/how2bof/tree/master).

# level1

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void func(int key){
	char overflowme[32];
	printf("overflow me : ");
	gets(overflowme);	// smash me!
	if(key == 0xcafebabe){
		system("/bin/sh");
	}
	else{
		printf("Nah..\n");
	}
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
	func(0xdeadbeef);
	return 0;
}
```

A small recap here for a very very important or it could be the most impotent thing that you need to master on dealing with `Stack Overflows`, which is `how data is pushed and poped to or from the stack?!`.

    note:
    that may become slightly different in less common calling conventions.

first when you start to call a function like "func" in the previous code what will happen? 
- the argument "0xdeadbeef" is pushed first.
- the call instruction itself will push the return address which is the address of the instruction after the call instruction.
-
